# hello-world
My first touch to GitHub, I guess?

Yeah, hi everyone, Joel here!
I'm new to VCS's and I have never used one before, so I took this "hello world-tutorial" (I guess that's what it's called).
I have anyways already some experience with coding as a hobby. I have used mostly web-languages (html5, css, js) WITHOUT JQUERY OR ANY OTHER LIBRARY (I like to do it myself, I usually don't want any external libraries messing up with my styles or code). Of course I'll use any libraries when needed, but fo now I've done fine enogh without any. I have also played around with Unity, C# and Python.
Recently I have been building some web crawler with Python and studied web scraping overall for myself.
